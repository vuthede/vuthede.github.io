<p>We all know that there are 2 main problems when training deep learning model which are overfitting and underfitting problems. Each problem have different solutions to tackle. e.g</p>
<ul>
  <li>With overfitting: Add more data, data augmentation, reduce complexity of model,etc</li>
  <li>With underfitting: Using bigger model, double-check some bugs (e.g inputâ€™s unnormalized, bug in loss function causing Nan value, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-my-case">2. My case</h3>
<p>At the beginning of my project, I train the eyegaze model and got the underfitting problem, the training loss looked like the image below.</p>

<image here="">

So then, I check the above-mentioned solutions:
- Using bigger model. From mobilev2 --&gt; resnet50. Does not fix.
- Check if input image is normalized. Yes it is normalized. 
- Loss function I used was **l2** 

$$ lossgaze = \sqrt(pred - gt)^2 $$

and it seems the loss values are the _normal_ float number, there is no Nan value here.
