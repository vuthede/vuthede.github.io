<p>We all know that there are 2 main problems when training deep learning model which are overfitting and underfitting problems. Each problem have different solutions to tackle. e.g</p>
<ul>
  <li>With overfitting: Add more data, data augmentation, reduce complexity of model,etc</li>
  <li>With underfitting: Using bigger model, double-check some bugs (e.g inputâ€™s unnormalized, bug in loss function causing Nan value, etc)</li>
</ul>
